# javascript-notes
Just a place to put notes and exercises from [The Modern Javascript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/) by [Ilya Kantor](https://github.com/javascript-tutorial).

As the name suggests, this is a notebook rather than an actual project. Expect a massive amount of comments, variables with names shadowing each other across different exercises within the same file, and other stuff that would generally not fly in production code.
