## Methods of primitive data types

JavaScript allows us to work with primitive data types (strings, numbers etc.) as if they were objects. To that end, a special object wrapper is created for the primitive data type, providing access to methods and properties. Then it is destroyed.

`null` and `undefined` do not have corresponding wrapper objects, and they provide no methods.
