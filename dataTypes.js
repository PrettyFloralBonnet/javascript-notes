// ----- METHODS OF PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES -----

// JavaScript allows us to work with primitive data types (strings, numbers etc.) as if they were objects.
// To that end, a special object wrapper is created for the primitive data type,
// providing access to methods and properties. Then it is destroyed.

// null and undefined

// These two types do not have corresponding wrapper objects and provide no methods.

// ----- NUMBERS -----

// wip
