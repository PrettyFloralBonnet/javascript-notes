## Object to primitive conversion

In the boolean context, all objects are `true`, so there is no boolean conversion. Only string and numeric conversions exist.

Numeric conversion takes place when we subtract objects or apply mathematical functions. For example, **date objects** can be subtracted. The result of `date1 - date2` is the time difference between the two dates.

String conversion usually takes place when we output an object using a function such as `alert(obj)`, or through a similar action.
