// ----- THE OLD "VAR" -----

// While in general "var" is no longer used in modern scripts, itâ€™s important to understand the differences
// between it and "let" when migrating old scripts, to avoid odd errors.

// var has no block scope

// Normally variables declared inside code blocks are not visible outside of the block scope:

if (true) {
    let test = true;  // use "let"
}

console.log(test);  // Error: test is not defined

// ...but if we use "var":

if (true) {
    var test = true;  // use "let"
}

console.log(test);  // true

// Variables declared with "var" are either function-wide or global (they're visible through blocks).
// The same thing applies to loops:

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // ...
}

console.log(i);  // 10 (i is visible after the loop)

// If a code block is inside of a function, "var" becomes a function-level variable:

function sayHi() {
    if (true) {
        var phrase = "Hello";
    }
    console.log(phrase);
}

sayHi();
console.log(phrase);  // Error: phrase is not defined

// The above happens because back when "var" was in use, JavaScript code blocks didn't have Lexical Environments.

// var accepts redeclarations

// With "var", we can redeclare a variable any number of times. If we use var with a variable that's already
// declared, it simply gets ignored:

var user = "Pete";
var user = "John";  // this "var" does nothing (already declared, no error)

console.log(user);  // John

// var allows variables to be declared after they are used

// Declarations made using "var" are processed when the function (or script) starts:

function sayHi() {
    phrase = "Hello";
    console.log(phrase);
    var phrase;
}
sayHi();

// The code above will work. Such behaviour is referred to as hoisting, because all variables declared with
// "var" are "hoisted" (raised) to the top of the function.

// Declarations are hoisted. Assignments are not. All "var" declarations are processed at the start of the function,
// so they can be referenced at any time, but they will be undefined until a value is assigned to them.

// IIFE

// Since there was no block-level visibility in the past, programmers found a way to emulate it with IIFE - 
// Immediately Invoked Function Expressions.

// An IIFE can look like this:

(function () {
    let message = "Hello";
    console.log(message);
})();

// In the example above, a function expression is created and immediately called, so it executes right away
// and has its own private variables.

// The reason the IIFE is wrapped in parentheses is when the interpreter encounters the "function" keyword in the code,
// it parses it as a start of a function declaration. However, a function declaration requires a function name,
// so the code would error out. And then even if we do add a name, it would still error out, because function declarations
// cannot be called immediately:

// function go() {
// do sth
// }();  // <-- Expression expected (cannot immediately call a function declaration)

// The parentheses are a trick to make the JavaScript interpreter see the function as created in the context of another
// expression, and therefore treat it as a function expression (so that it doesn't need a name and can be called immediately).

// There are in fact multiple ways to create an IIFE:

(function () {
    console.log("Parentheses around the function");
})();

(function () {
    console.log("Parentheses around the entire expression");
}());

!function () {
    console.log("Bitwise operator NOT at the beginning of the expression");
}();

+function () {
    console.log("Unary plus at the beginning of the expression");
}();

// Again, this is mostly for historical purposes - nowadays there should be no reason to write code like this.
